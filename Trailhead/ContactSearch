//Create an Apex class that returns contacts based on incoming parameters.

// The method searches for contacts that have a last name matching the first string and a mailing postal code matching the second.
// It gets the ID and Name of those contacts and returns them.

//The Apex class must be called ContactSearch and be in the public scope
//The Apex class must have a public static method called searchForContacts
//The method must accept two incoming strings as parameters
//The method should then find any contact that has a last name matching the first string, and mailing postal code (API name: MailingPostalCode) matching the second string
//The method should finally return a list of Contact records of type List that includes the ID and Name fields

//즉 검색기능임. 성과 우편번호를 입력하고 그에 해당하는 조건을 반환
public with sharing class ContactSearch {
    public static List<Contact> searchForContacts(String lastName, String PostalCode) { //성과 우편번호를 입력받음

        List<Contact>contacts = [
                SELECT ID, Name, LastName, MailingPostalCode
                FROM Contact
                WHERE LastName = :lastName AND MailingPostalCode = :PostalCode
        ];
        System.debug(contacts);

        return contacts;
